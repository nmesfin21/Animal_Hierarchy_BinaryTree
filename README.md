# Animal_Hierarchy_BinaryTree
This is a class project for my data structure and algorithm class. The program reads an input text file and store each words in from the file until it reaches a $$ symbol. Then it stores the names (in this case, the animal names) and stores them in binary tree. Then, it display how many times a name of animal is mensioned in the file. For instance, if lion is mensioned in the file 4 time, it will show the lion -----> 4. It does this for each anmial names. Finally, it displays the tree structure sideways. 

This project has given me a great opportunity to have a solid understanding of bin tree data structure.
